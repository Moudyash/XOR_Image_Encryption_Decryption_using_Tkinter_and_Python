 <h3>This code uses the Tkinter library in Python to create a GUI for encrypting and decrypting images using the XOR encryption method. The user can select an image using a file dialog, and the program will perform the encryption or decryption operation on the selected image. The program also includes error handling and a loading screen for the user. The final encrypted image will be stored as a .bin file and decrypted image will be stored as .jpg file.</h3>
